## The Lesson

During the early days of Once UI, I thought the hardest part of success was building the product. I saw countless mediocre products thriving, so I figured if I could just build something great, it would sell itself.

Oh, how wrong I was...

Building Once UI taught me an important life lesson:

> Building is easy. Selling is hard.

## The Beginnings

In 2022, I was eagerly searching for a new role at a startup. I had developed solid technical skills and spent 3 years building [Creatillo](https://creatillo.com) to showcase my expertise in design and front-end technologies.

Despite having above-average technical skills, I lacked soft skills. I applied to over 50 startups that year, got around 20 interviews, and received 0 offers. People were impressed by my technical expertise, but I struggled to convey my ideas verbally. My last interview at [Lokalise](https://lokalise.com), where I was turned down after the final round with C-level executives, marked the end of that chapter.

Although I wasn’t fully satisfied at [Kinsta](https://kinsta.com), it felt like the perfect time to start a side business.

I’ve always considered myself an efficient person—able to build quickly without getting bogged down in details. With this mindset, I started working on [Once UI](https://once-ui.com) in November 2022.

## The Launch

After 2 months of relentless work in Figma and building a custom landing page in Vue, I was ready to launch, expecting passive income to start flowing and dreaming of retiring on a sandy beach with a Mojito in hand. Two years have passed, and I’m writing this post from a cozy 45-square-meter apartment. No beach in sight.

It’s easy to assume your product is the one the world desperately needs, but the reality is:

> Nobody cares about you or your product. People care about themselves and their product.

Launching for the first time is a double-edged sword. You can either gain momentum like a rockstar or vanish in the endless digital noise.

## Marketing is Tough

Marketing is a builder’s nightmare. It consumes precious time you’d rather spend refining your product—only to hear *crickets*, or worse:

> GTFO, dude.

## Finding Our Audience

I had to learn the hard way that success isn’t about creating the perfect product, but about finding your audience. For a long time, we couldn’t find Once UI’s audience. Our primary target group—designers, who I thought would appreciate a tool that simplified their workflow—were anything but impressed. In fact, they were defensive about their existing processes.

That’s when I realized I wasn’t equipped to reshape an entire industry. We needed a new angle. At this point, I wasn’t working on Once UI alone—I had teamed up with Zsofia Komaromi. While working on an open-source project, Zsofia suggested we shift our focus to building an open-source UI library. After all, code is where the real impact happens.

We were knee-deep in building Once UI for Next.js, and without the incredible support from the Next.js community, I doubt we could have pulled it off—especially not in just two months.

## Another Launch

By this point, we had gone through 5-6 major launches. We knew how to prepare assets, communicate effectively, and build anticipation. Once UI is unique in so many ways, it seemed impossible for it to be overlooked.

But guess what?

> We launched, and nobody cared.

Maybe we didn’t prepare enough. Maybe we just had bad luck that day. Everything seemed to be against us. But I didn’t care. Nothing was going to stop us.

## The Now

We didn’t get a rockstar moment.
We didn’t have investors knocking on our door.

But we’ve been grinding like crazy for over two years—building, shipping, and iterating every single day.

And now? People are genuinely interested in Once UI. More and more designers are starting to develop, and more and more developers are starting to design with Once UI.

## Success

I’ve realized that success isn’t sipping Mojitos on a beach. It’s waking up every day excited to work on your own ideas and contribute to the design and development community.
