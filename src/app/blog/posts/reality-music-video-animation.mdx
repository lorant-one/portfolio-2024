## New series: from my archives

It’s been quite a journey to becoming a developer working on design and dev tools. Along the way, I’ve worked on some projects I’m really proud of, and I’d love to share a few highlights.

This one is a low-poly 3D scene with an animated camera that I made back in my university days—7 years ago! I built it in 3DMax and did the post-processing in After Effects.

Crazy how fast time flies, but I’m still super proud of this project. Hope you enjoy it out as much as I enjoyed creating it.

+ From start to finish it took me 3 months to complete (including render time).
+ I used 30 cameras and two different light setups (day and night).
+ There's a longer shot at 1:34 where two complete camera renders (with different lights) are fading into each other, creating a time-lapse effect.
+ Total render time was 300 hours on a Dell notebook (i7 6700HQ & 8GB RAM).
+ The sequences were processed in After Effects, and the final project contained over 1000 layers.
