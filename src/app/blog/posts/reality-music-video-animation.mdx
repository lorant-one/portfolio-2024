## New series: from my archives

I took a long road until I got to be a developer working on design and dev tooling. I want to highlight some of my favorite projects and milestones from this road.

This one is a low-poly 3D scene with an animated camera. It was built in 3DMax and post-processed in After Effects. It's from my university years, made 7 years ago.

Gosh... Time flies...

Anyway, hope you'll enjoy.

+ From start to finish it took me 3 months to complete (including render time).
+ I used 30 cameras and two different light setups (day and night).
+ There's a longer shot at 1:34 where two complete camera renders (with different lights) are fading into each other, creating a time-lapse effect.
+ Total render time was 300 hours on a Dell notebook (i7 6700HQ & 8GB RAM).
+ The sequences were processed in After Effects, and the final project contained over 1000 layers.
