## We act like it’s fine. But deep down, we all feel the same
Everything around us is changing—faster than we ever expected. AI is evolving at a pace no one fully grasps. Corporations are racing to control it. Governments are scrambling to regulate AI—but it’s mostly theater. Lawmakers hold press conferences while tech billionaires shape policy behind closed doors.

> Every delay gives corporations more control.

And the rest of us? We're just trying to keep up, pretending everything is fine.

But deep down, we know it’s not.

- We see the cracks forming.
- We feel the uncertainty.

We know that if we don’t act now, the future won’t belong to us—it will be handed to those who control the tools, the platforms, and the narratives.

And if that happens, we won’t just lose our jobs.
- We’ll lose our ability to create.
- We’ll lose our independence.
- We’ll lose what makes us human.

## The illusion of progress: AI isn’t being built for us
AI was supposed to be the great equalizer.
A tool that made creation accessible.
A force that liberated us from the constraints of corporate control.

Instead, we’re watching it become the opposite.

Big Tech is closing its doors, locking AI behind paywalls, restricting who can use it and how. OpenAI, the company that was founded on the promise of open-source AI, has shifted to a closed, corporate model, ensuring that only those who can afford it can truly benefit.

And what’s the alternative? China’s DeepSeek AI—fully open-source, but not for the reasons we’d hope. This isn’t about empowering independent creators or making AI fair. It’s a geopolitical move in the AI arms race, designed to undercut Western dominance.

> Neither side is building AI to serve us. They’re using AI to compete for control.

Openness alone isn’t the answer if the intent behind it is just to win a war.
And closed systems only concentrate power even further.

The real solution? AI that is _open_, but also _community-driven_, _decentralized_, and _independent_ of corporate or government control. That’s what we should be fighting for.

But tools alone won’t save us.

What we need is a community. A movement.

> People who think, create, and build together.

That’s the idea behind the Design Engineers Club.
Not as a business. Not as a corporate entity.
But as a _decentralized movement_ of creators, developers, designers, and thinkers who refuse to sit back and watch the world be built without them.

## What we’re doing, and how you can be part of it
<Text onBackground="accent-medium" weight="strong">We create.</Text>
We build tools, products, and platforms that empower creatives, not corporations. We work on open-source projects like [Once UI](https://once-ui.com), making it easier for designers and developers to build without relying on locked ecosystems.

But building alone isn’t enough. We need contributors—developers who can help improve our tools, designers who can refine interfaces, and creators who can make resources more accessible.

<Text onBackground="accent-medium" weight="strong">We connect.</Text>
We bring together developers, designers, artists, and builders who are tired of working in isolation, competing against each other, or waiting for a company to “give them a chance.”

> We create our own opportunities.

Community isn’t just an idea—it’s action.
- Moderators who help keep discussions alive on Discord.
- Writers & educators who document knowledge, share insights, and help others learn.
- Artists who design merch, branding, and community visuals to make our movement more vivid and personal.

<Text onBackground="accent-medium" weight="strong">We learn.</Text> The world is changing too fast for anyone to keep up alone. We exchange ideas, share insights, and stay ahead of trends—not just reacting, but actively shaping where things go next.

But learning isn't passive—we build real tools that help others grow, create, and adapt.

> And most importantly: We stay human.

AI isn’t going away. Automation is inevitable. But that doesn’t mean we should just let it replace us. We believe AI should serve creators, not control them. We build responsibly, we innovate, but we never lose what makes creativity real.

## We don’t have time to wait.
- Right now, corporations are locking AI behind paywalls.
- Right now, governments are making AI a geopolitical weapon instead of a tool for people.
- Right now, social platforms are being hijacked, engagement is manipulated, and creativity is being commodified instead of celebrated.

And right now, the people who should be shaping the future—us—are being sidelined.

We have two choices:
- Wait and see what happens.
- Or start building something of our own.

## How we sustain ourselves—and how you can help
We believe tools that empower people should be free and open. That’s why Once UI is open-source, and why we share our knowledge freely.

But building and growing a movement requires resources.

If you believe in what we’re doing and want to help us expand, you can support us by [subscribing to Once UI Pro](https://once-ui.com/figma) or [purchasing merch](https://store.dopler.app).

We’ll keep building, no matter what. But if you have the means to support us, your contribution makes a difference.

## The Design Engineers Club isn’t a brand. It’s an idea.
A community-driven movement where creatives take back control.
Where we build, together.

The world is changing. Let’s make sure it changes in the right direction.

> Join the movement. Build with us.
