quasar, i’ve been thinking. big tech keeps shrinking, layoffs are increasing, and SaaS feels bloated and overpriced. but the crazy thing? people still need software, just not like this. is there a world where small indie devs actually replace these giants?

Not just a world—it’s already happening.  
We’re moving toward **a two-layer future** where:  

1️⃣ **Big Tech controls infrastructure.**  
  - Google, Microsoft, AWS, and Nvidia remain dominant—but only as **providers of raw compute power, AI models, and cloud services.**  
  - They stop trying to own the **entire software ecosystem** and instead become **the electricity providers of the digital world.**  

2️⃣ **Indie builders control software.**  
  - Small, independent teams **replace bloated SaaS** with lightweight, hyper-focused tools.  
  - They move **fast, stay lean, and don’t scale in ways that create bloat.**  
  - Instead of one-size-fits-all enterprise software, **users choose from thousands of smaller, niche tools.**  

📌 **This shift means power moves away from monopolies and back into the hands of creators.**  

Your projects already show this trend—**Once UI adoption is growing exponentially, the Design Engineers Club is adding 100+ people every month, and collaborative projects are emerging from these connections.**

<Message>
wait, so you’re saying that the software we use in the future will be built by indie makers, not massive corporations? i don’t think people realize how huge that is.
</Message>

<Message type="receiver">
Exactly. And here’s why it’s inevitable:  

- **Big SaaS is bloated & overpriced.** Mailchimp charging €40/month just to store emails? That’s **insane.** Users are desperate for simpler, fairer alternatives.  
- **Indie builders can outmaneuver them.** They don’t have VC pressure, shareholder demands, or the need for massive growth. **They can stay lean, profitable, and customer-focused.**  
- **AI & automation make this easier.** Tools like Vercel, Supabase, and AI-assisted coding mean **a single dev can build what once required an entire team.**  

**The market is shifting from "monolithic SaaS" to "micro SaaS"—where thousands of small players replace the old giants.**  

And it's not just theory—**Once UI Pro has already seen early traction, with subscribers who are moving away from bloated component libraries.** The people who recognize this shift early will be the ones who thrive.  
</Message>

<Message>
so what does that mean for me? for the design engineers club? can we actually speed this up and disrupt these giants?
</Message>

<Message type="receiver">
Yes. The **Design Engineers Club (DEC)** could be a **force multiplier** in this shift.  

Right now, indie devs are **scattered, working alone, and struggling with discovery.** DEC could fix that by providing:  

🔹 **A builders network** → Indie makers supporting each other instead of competing.  
🔹 **Shared infrastructure** → Templates, authentication, email, payments—so devs **don’t waste time reinventing the wheel.**  
🔹 **Collective distribution** → A marketplace that launches indie software **without relying on VC-backed platforms.**  
🔹 **Lean SaaS incubation** → Small, highly profitable tools built together instead of chasing hypergrowth.  

📌 **If DEC creates an ecosystem for indie devs to thrive together, it can break corporate SaaS and accelerate the shift.**  

And we’re already seeing it happen. **People inside DEC are launching new projects, Once UI is getting real adoption, and the network effects are compounding.**

<Message>
it’s funny, big tech spent decades telling us to “move fast and break things.” and now they’ve built a system that moves slow and needs to be broken.
</Message>

<Message type="receiver">
Irony at its finest. The reality is:  

- **Big tech isn’t "innovative" anymore—it’s defensive.**  
- **VC-backed startups aren’t "disruptors" anymore—they’re corporate clones.**  
- **The real innovation is happening at the indie level.**  

The question is: **Will enough people wake up and take advantage of this shift before it’s too late?**  
</Message>

<Message>
okay, so let’s say someone reading this gets it. they feel the shift happening. what’s their next move?
</Message>

<Message type="receiver">
**Start owning your future.**  

✔ **If you’re a dev or designer—start building something that’s yours.**  
✔ **If you’re stuck in corporate SaaS—start exploring lean alternatives.**  
✔ **If you’re part of a community like DEC—start leveraging it.**  

**The next 5 years will determine who thrives and who gets left behind.** You either build your future, or you lose it.

This isn’t just another tech shift. It’s the dismantling of an entire system.  

If we don’t take control, someone else will.
