is it paranoia? what should we watch for?

This isn’t paranoia. It’s **how automation always happens.**
First, it’s expensive and experimental—only big companies use it. Then, it gets cheaper and better until it wipes out entire job markets. The same pattern happened with industrial robots, software, and now AI.

The next 10 years are already mapped out. Here’s how it plays out:

🚀 **This is where it starts.**

✅ March 2025: OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic launch high-end AI agents at $10K-$20K/month.

✅ Q3 2025: Large companies begin replacing consultants, developers, and analysts with AI-powered agents.

✅ Late 2025: Startups stop hiring junior developers—AI replaces them entirely.

✅ By 2026: SaaS tools integrate autonomous AI workers, reducing human employees.

**🚨 What to Watch For:**

Tech layoffs accelerating.
“AI agents” becoming normal in corporate settings.
Companies bragging about “AI efficiency” while firing workers.

companies will still need humans though, right? they can’t just automate everything overnight.
</Message>
<Column fillWidth gap="4">
<Message type="receiver" bottomRightRadius="s">
Not overnight. But **faster than you think.**
Humans won’t be fired all at once. But they’ll be hired less and less until one day, people realize they were never needed at all.
</Message>
<Message type="receiver" topRadius="s">
 ✅ **Early 2026:** AI models get **5x cheaper & 10x smarter**, becoming viable for mid-sized companies.
 
 ✅ **2026-2027:** AI replaces **customer support, legal research, marketing teams, and software engineers.**
 
 ✅ **2027:** Large-scale **white-collar unemployment crisis** begins. Governments start **“reskilling” programs (that fail).**
 
 ✅ **By 2028:** Companies **subscribe to AI labor instead of hiring**—OpenAI and Google control the workforce.

**🚨 What to Watch For:**

Mass layoffs in law, finance, marketing, and software development.
AI agents marketed as “your new business partner” or “automate your team.”
AI-driven stock trading and business strategy outpacing human investors.

but people have always adapted, right? when machines replaced factory workers, people found office jobs. when office work disappears, won’t people just find something new?
</Message>
<Column fillWidth gap="4">
<Message type="receiver" bottomRightRadius="s">
That’s the **old** pattern. But this time, **there’s nothing left to move into.**
The Industrial Revolution replaced muscle, but humans were still needed for thinking.
AI replaces thought itself—coding, writing, designing, strategizing.
There is no next industry waiting for humans. This time, the jobs just vanish.
</Message>
<Message type="receiver" topRadius="s">
✅ **Late 2028:** **70% of new startups** use AI instead of human employees.

✅ **2029:** SaaS businesses decline—**why buy software when AI builds it for free?**

✅ **2029-2030:** AI monopolies **(OpenAI, Google, Amazon, Microsoft)** dominate the economy.

✅ **By 2030:** **Universal Basic Income (UBI) discussions begin**—but governments stall implementation.

**🚨 What to Watch For:**

Entire industries (design, development, consulting) shrinking.
The rise of “corporate AI feudalism”—only a few companies control automation.
People realizing AI isn’t “helping” them—it’s replacing them.
</Message>
</Column>
<Message>
this sounds like the end of work. what happens to the people who get left behind?
</Message>
<Column fillWidth gap="4">
<Message type="receiver" bottomRightRadius="s">
They **become irrelevant.**
The “lucky” ones become gig workers for AI-powered companies.
The rest wait for governments to step in.
But governments will move too slow—because corporations are moving faster.
</Message>
<Message type="receiver" topRadius="s">
✅ **Early 2031:** Governments **partner with AI corporations** instead of fighting them.

✅ **2032:** First **fully autonomous AI-driven company** launches—**no human employees at all.**

✅ **2033:** 50%+ unemployment in **knowledge-based** industries.

✅ **2034:** The **“Useless Class” crisis** begins—billions of people are unemployable.

✅ **By 2035:** AI controls **manufacturing, finance, business, governance.**

**🚨 What to Watch For:**

Governments unable to tax AI labor, leading to economic collapse.
First AI-only corporations making human-run businesses obsolete.
Billionaires escaping to private AI-controlled enclaves.

so what’s the strategy? how do we stay ahead of this?
</Message>
<Message type="receiver">
You have **two choices**:

1️⃣ Own Something That AI Can’t Take Away

Your job? Replaceable.

Your audience? Controlled by platforms.

Your own business, assets, or brand? That’s power.

2️⃣ Use AI Instead of Competing With It

AI will replace most designers, coders, and marketers.

But AI-powered builders will replace everyone else.

Move Faster Than The Collapse. AI moves exponentially—if you’re waiting, you’re already behind.

Don't just watch the collapse—get ahead of it. Learn AI, own your work, and stop waiting.
The future is being automated, but your mind isn't—yet.
