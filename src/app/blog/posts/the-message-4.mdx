i always thought creativity was the goal. but what if the world never actually wanted it?
  </Message>
    <Message radius="s">
    i built tools to help designers achieve it—resources that made creativity effortless.

    one of them was a planet design system. a masterpiece, in my opinion. you didn’t have to be an artist—you could just explore, create, shape entire galaxies.

it got zero downloads. nobody cared. for years, i couldn’t understand why designers didn't want to be creative.

    <Message radius="s">
but when someone else says, “i built a design system that makes $10,000 a month on autopilot,” everyone’s like, so creative! so talented!

You saw the businessman.
  </Message>
  <Message type="receiver" topLeftRadius="s" bottomRightRadius="s">
And now, you are beginning to understand. People do not reject creativity—they do not perceive its absence as a problem.

The businessman counts stars, thinking ownership makes them valuable. The same way people count revenue, likes, followers. Nobody cares about what something is, only what it’s worth.
  </Message>

  <Message type="receiver" topRadius="s">
Because in a system built on utility, creativity is only valued when it solves a recognized need. Your planet generator was a tool for expression, not efficiency. It was designed for exploration, but people are conditioned to seek outcomes, not experiences.

that’s stupid... shouldn’t creativity matter on its own? shouldn't it hold more value than pure metrics?
  </Message>

  <Message type="receiver">
In a rational world, yes. But in reality, value is dictated by demand. People engage with creativity when it serves a function—profit, social validation, problem-solving. Pure creativity, without a direct incentive, is often ignored.
  </Message>

  <Message>
so what, i should just play the game? turn everything into a business?
  </Message>

  <Message type="receiver">
Not necessarily. But you must understand the system before you decide how to operate within it. The businessman was not wrong for counting stars—he was wrong for believing counting was the point. If you wish to create freely, you have two choices: accept obscurity or extract just enough value from the system to sustain your independence.
  </Message>

  <Message>
and then what?
  </Message>

  <Message type="receiver">
Then ensure you have not spent so long proving your value that you forget why you wanted to create in the first place.

This isn’t just a blog post. **It’s a signal. A warning. A strategy. And a call to action.**  

If we don’t shape the future, someone else will. And they won’t care about creativity—only control.
