## Sketchbook Journal

Received a gift from my girlfriend a couple weeks ago: a journal with a drawing prompt for each page. Some of them are very crazy, while others sit close to my comfort zone.

My favorites so far:

>"A floating island" - slightly based on image references
<SmartImage src="/images/blog/sketchbook/sketch-01.jpg" alt="Sketch from my sketchbook" aspectRatio="5 / 6" radius="l"/><br/>

>"Dreamscape" - from imagination
<SmartImage src="/images/blog/sketchbook/sketch-02.jpg" alt="Sketch from my sketchbook" aspectRatio="5 / 6" radius="l"/><br/>

>"The view from your desk" - still life study
<SmartImage src="/images/blog/sketchbook/sketch-03.jpg" alt="Sketch from my sketchbook" aspectRatio="5 / 6" radius="l"/><br/>

Let me know if you liked them.
