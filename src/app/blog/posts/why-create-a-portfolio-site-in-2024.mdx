This article is the first part of a series to help you build your perfect portfolio. This time, we're focusing on the why: Why should you even create a portfolio?

## #1 Convenient for clients

As a creative, you need to showcase your work to be hired or to get clients. You don't necessary need a portfolio site: you can create a pdf, a Figma file, or even put your work on social sites like dribbble, behance, or even X.

So why opt for a portfolio site?

Well, I'd say it's the most convenient for clients: pdfs are large in size, soacial sites limit what and how you can publish, and Figma files are just bad in performance.

## #2 Personal branding

If you want to position yourself higher in the market, you need to focus on building a trustworthy, professional personal brand. You simply can't do it without a website.

## #3 Control the narrative

With a custom portfolio site, you can control how your work is being presented and on which part you want to put the emphasis, keeping a fine balance between visual and text-based content.

## #4 Improved Reach

On social media, your visibility is defined by factors that you have very few control over. Having a personal website gives you the opportunity to reach people from search engines.

> Tip: While you can't control the reach of your posts, you can share your portfolio site on social media sites such as X or Threads, in comments, under popular posts where the author specifically asks what others are building. It's a powerful way to lead visitors to your site.

## #5 Entry point

Your portfolio website can be a great entry point for different target groups: if you're building a mailing list, you can encourage sign ups. If you're a freelancer, you can showcase your work and help clients get in touch with you.
