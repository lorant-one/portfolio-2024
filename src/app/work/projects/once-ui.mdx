## Introduction


Once UI is a customizable design system crafted for the next generation of web applications. Our vision is shaped by key principles that we believe will define the future of the web:

<Flex
  style={{overflow:'hidden'}}
  direction="column"
  background="surface"
  fillWidth maxWidth="xs"
  border="neutral-medium" borderStyle="solid-1" radius="l"
  marginTop="12"
  marginBottom="8">
  <Accordion
    style={{marginTop: '-1px'}}
    title="Accessible.">
    In a digital landscape that spans all demographics, accessibility is essential. Next-generation apps prioritize inclusivity through optimal color contrasts, alt texts, ARIA labels, and more, ensuring seamless engagement for everyone.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="Responsive.">
    Next-generation apps are characterized by flawless functionality across all devices and screen sizes, delivering a consistent user experience everywhere.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="Customizable.">
    User preferences are paramount. Next-generation apps offer dynamic interfaces with customizable color schemes, motion settings, and themes, catering even to specific needs like color blindness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="Performant.">
    While aesthetics are important, speed is crucial. Prioritizing swift load times and smooth performance, next-generation apps respect the user's time and resources.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="Sustainable.">
    Acknowledging the environmental impact of the digital world, next-generation apps emphasize sustainable practices and efficient resource use.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="Secure.">
    As digital adoption grows, so do security threats. Next-generation apps enforce strong security measures to protect user data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="Ethical.">
    Transparency, fairness, and responsibility are at our core. Next-generation apps avoid exploitative practices, focusing on genuine value and ethical standards.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="Purpose-Driven.">
    Next-generation apps are purpose-driven: they go beyond a collection of features, serving as targeted solutions to specific problems. Instead of scaling infinitely, they focus on refining and perfecting the solution for the challenge at hand.
  </Accordion>
</Flex>

## Token System

From the beginning, we recognized that building on a stable foundation was critical for the success of Once UI. Our principles guided us away from gimmicks designed to maximize profit, instead steering us toward a well-defined path focused on the future. We're playing the long game.

The foundational layer of a web framework consists of the tokens or variables responsible for styling and customization. We developed our own standard that allows for endless customization with minimal code overhead, all separated from the core logic into a single file.

## Figma System

Once the token system was defined, we translated it into Figma and CSS variables, building the component system on this foundational layer.

We also created comprehensive documentation for all tokens and components. At this point, our idea was taking shape, and we could already envision endless possibilities, though we were still far from our ultimate goal. With numerous UI kits already available for Figma, we soon realized that this wasn’t the field we wanted to compete in.

## Next.js Library

> Hey GPT, should we create our design system in React or Next.js?

The answer was Next.js. And today, I'm thrilled that it was. We absolutely love [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and it has opened up a whole new world for us.

You might be wondering...

> Why not Tailwind?

Tailwind is great, I get it. But I worry about a future where everything relies on a single approach. While Tailwind might be an excellent choice for many products, it has its own challenges. From my perspective, the main issue is the lack of semantics, which prevents healthy boundaries and constraints. We could have written a wrapper around it, but I had a clear vision of the ideal tokenized system and didn’t want to compromise. I can confidently say that prototyping and brand evolution are a breeze with our token system.

## The Present

Once UI is slowly gaining traction, and we're genuinely excited about it. The positive feedback we’ve received encourages us to continue building and improving. Convincing people to adopt Once UI has been challenging due to low initial adoption, so we decided to build and publish our own products. We’ll offer open-source, public, and paid templates.

Our first release is Magic Portfolio, which we believe could be a strong contender for the best public portfolio template available.

## Community

Once UI is more than just a product; it’s about a vision and a community. We aim to influence how the next generation of the web is built. We envision a future where designers write code and developers create beautiful interfaces. We foresee the rise of design engineering. Join us on this mission!
