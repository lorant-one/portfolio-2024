## Intro
Once UI is a customizable design system built for the next generation of web apps. Our vision centers on where we see the future of the web heading, based on key principles:

<span style={{color: 'var(--brand-on-background-weak)'}}>Accessible</span>
In a digital age spanning all demographics, accessibility is crucial. Next-gen apps prioritize inclusivity through optimal colors, alt texts, ARIA labels, and more to ensure everyone can engage seamlessly.

<span style={{color: 'var(--brand-on-background-weak)'}}>Responsive</span>
Flawless functionality across all devices and screen sizes defines next-gen apps, delivering a consistent user experience everywhere.

<span style={{color: 'var(--brand-on-background-weak)'}}>Customizable</span>
User preferences come first. Next-gen apps offer dynamic interfaces with customizable color schemes, motion settings, and themes, catering even to niche needs like color blindness.

<span style={{color: 'var(--brand-on-background-weak)'}}>Performant</span>
While aesthetics matter, speed is paramount. Prioritizing swift load times and smooth performance, next-gen apps respect the user's time and resources.

<span style={{color: 'var(--brand-on-background-weak)'}}>Sustainable</span>
Recognizing the digital worldâ€™s environmental impact, next-gen apps emphasize sustainable practices and efficient resource use.

<span style={{color: 'var(--brand-on-background-weak)'}}>Secure</span>
As digital adoption grows, so do threats. Next-gen apps uphold strong security measures to protect user data.

<span style={{color: 'var(--brand-on-background-weak)'}}>Ethical</span>
Transparency, fairness, and responsibility are core values. Next-gen apps avoid exploitative tactics, focusing on genuine value and ethical practices.

<span style={{color: 'var(--brand-on-background-weak)'}}>Purpose-Driven</span>
We empower startups to thrive by offering support in product development, funding, and scalable solutions, easing the burdens on founders.

## Token system

Recognizing early on that building on stable foundations was paramount for the success of Once UI. Our principles doesn't allow us to build gimmicks to maximize income, instead it lead us towards a well defined path to build for the future. We're paying the long game.

The foundation layer of a web framework are the tokens or variables responsible for styling and customization. We've come up with our own standard that allows endless customization options with very minimal code overhead, separated from the core logic into a single file.

## Figma system

When we had the token system defined, we've translated them to Figma and CSS variables, and then we've built the component system on this foundational layer, and then a comprehensive documentation for all tokens and components. At this point our idea was shaping up nicely and we could already see the endless opportunities, although we were very far from our
