## A unified brand

Since the release of [Once UI](https://once-ui.com), we've been on a roll—launching new resources, templates, and products nearly every week. Despite this rapid pace, we always prioritize quality over quantity. We consider scalability early on and implement the necessary infrastructure to support our growth smoothly.

This mindset led us to create [Dopler](https://dopler.app), our "holding brand," which serves as a structured and cohesive home for our projects. Dopler brings order, hierarchy, and unity to our work.

## Strong values

For us, building is about more than profit. We’re guided by values that shape our work and reflect our vision for a better future.

We believe in sustainable growth, a focus on quality over quantity, and a shift towards balance. 

## Importance of communities

We envision a future driven by smaller, more intentional communities rather than mass social media. Social media, as it stands, often amplifies false information, promotes unrealistic lifestyles, and fosters hostility. That's why we built [Enroll](https://enroll.dopler.app)—a waitlist app designed to help you build your own community.

You might think it’s challenging to attract people away from mindlessly scrolling social apps, but we’ve seen the desire for real connection. People are tired of FOMO, constant comparison, and obeying algorithms. Whether you're planning to launch your own product or build an audience, starting with a community is a great first step.

We encourage you to start building a space for your own niche community. Real connection lies in shared values and focused groups, not fleeting social media feeds.

## Your support matters

As a bootstrapped team, we don’t have the luxury of stable funding. We work tirelessly on what we love because we believe it’s both essential and impactful. Every sign urges us to keep pushing forward, and we need your support to continue creating open-source, accessible software and to share valuable insights and resources for free.

Instead of donations, we aim to provide value. You can support our mission by joining the [Design Engineers Club](https://club.dopler.io), building your own community with [Enroll](https://enroll.dopler.app), or using [Once UI](https://once-ui.com) to design and build your own apps. Additionally, [our merch store](https://store.dopler.app) features exclusive items—shirts, hoodies, desk mats, and prints inspired by past projects like the [Journal of the Universe](https://creatillo.com/creator/journal-of-the-universe) and the [Design Engineers Club](https://club.dopler.io).

## Now, start creating

One of the greatest lessons I’ve learned is that creating brings more joy and fulfillment than consuming. Don’t hesitate to create and share your work with the world. Now, more than ever, your unique contributions are essential.
