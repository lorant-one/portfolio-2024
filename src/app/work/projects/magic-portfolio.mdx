## Embracing Creators

With the rapid rise of LLMs, social media feeds have become cluttered with low-quality, inauthentic content. On the flip side, LLMs have democratized development, enabling people with limited technical knowledge to build, deploy, and maintain high-quality websites in record time. This, in my opinion, sets the stage for a resurgence of personal websites and blogs.

These websites are truly authentic, undisturbed spaces without the noise of algorithms. I’m confident that more creatives will opt for an online presence that is independent of algorithm-driven platforms.

## Magic Portfolio

We are excited to support this movement by providing unique tools tailored for design engineers—creatives who are comfortable with code and refuse to compromise on design.
